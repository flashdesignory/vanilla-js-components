# Components

**Atomic Design**
Atomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages concurrently working together to create effective interface design systems.

### Atoms

Atoms are our foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

### Molecules

Molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

### Organisms

Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

**Common Functions**
A starting point of an api interface of some sort, these functions are commonly used in many of the components.

---

### constructor

Generates basic setup of elements that are permanent during component lifecycles.

### update

Updates component state values and runs update functions of child components.

### updapteDisplay

Updates and renders child components changes.

### rebuild

Updates dynamic elements list to prepare for render function.
Often used for dynamic lists or lazyloading of data.

### fireEvent

Dispatches a new event typically from the container element.

### render

Adds dynamic elements to the container element and renders updates of child components.

**Event Functions**
Event callback functions, follow the same naming convention, unless multiple elements within a component use the same event type. In those cases, a more descriptive name will be used, to be able to differentiate between the callback handlers.
